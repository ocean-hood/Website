      <h1>Interconnectedness between microorganisms and climate change</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-text">
      <p>
        Microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy global
        ecosystem and are essential for the existence of all higher trophic life
        forms. Climate change is impacting most life on Earth, including
        microorganisms. Microorganisms have key roles in carbon and nutrient
        cycling, animal and plant health, agriculture, and the global food web.
        Changes in microbial biodiversity and activities will affect the
        resilience of all other organisms and hence their ability to respond to
        climate change. Harmful microorganisms can cause diseases in humans,
        animals, and plants. Anthropogenic climate change exacerbates the global
        spread of vector-borne pathogens and their diseases, increases
        antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms, and stresses marine life,
        causing disease and disrupting normal ecosystem function.

        Human activities have a direct impact on microorganisms and contribute
        to greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, agriculture, industrial
        activities, and pollution all affect microbial communities and
        contribute to climate change. Deforestation reduces carbon dioxide
        absorption by trees and affects soil microbial communities, which play a
        crucial role in nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Agriculture
        contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through the use of fertilisers,
        which release nitrous oxide during microbial processes, and livestock
        farming, which produces methane. Industrial activities, such as the
        burning of fossil fuels, release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
        Pollution from human activities, such as oil spills and wastewater
        treatment, can affect microbial communities and contribute to greenhouse
        gas emissions. It's crucial to understand the role of microorganisms in
        greenhouse gas emissions and incorporate this knowledge into research,
        technology development, and policy and management decisions for
        effective mitigation of climate change.

        The impact of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations on ocean
        temperature, acidification, stratification, mixing, thermohaline
        circulation, nutrient supply, irradiation, and extreme weather events
        affects the marine microbiota in ways that have substantial
        environmental consequences, including major shifts in productivity,
        marine food webs, carbon export, and burial in the seabed. Marine
        phytoplankton performs half of the global photosynthetic CO2 fixation
        and half of the oxygen production, despite amounting to only ~1% of
        global plant biomass. Therefore, phytoplankton respond rapidly on a
        global scale to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rising temperatures not only affect biological processes but also reduce
        water density and thereby stratification and circulation, which affect
        organismal dispersal and nutrient transport. Precipitation, salinity,
        and winds also affect stratification, mixing, and circulation. Nutrient
        inputs from air, river, and estuarine flows also affect microbial
        community composition and function, and climate change affects all these
        physical factors. The overall relevance of microorganisms to ocean
        ecosystems can be appreciated from their number and biomass in the water
        column and subsurface: the total number of cells is more than 10^29, and
        the Census of Marine Life estimates that 90% of marine biomass is
        microbial .
