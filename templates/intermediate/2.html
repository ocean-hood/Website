      <h1>Phytoplankton and its types</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-text">
      <p>
        Phytoplankton are microscopic plants found in marine and aquatic
        ecosystems. Just like plants found on land, phytoplankton contain green
        pigments called chlorophyll, which absorb light to provide energy for
        photosynthesis. Because phytoplankton need light to live and grow, most
        are found floating at the top layers of the ocean where sunlight
        penetrates the water. These plants are also the foundation of the
        aquatic food web. They are on the menu for everyone from microscopic
        zooplankton like copepods to multi-ton whales. According to some
        estimates, phytoplankton provide 50 to 80 percent of the world’s oxygen
        and absorb between 30 to 50 percent of the world’s carbon.
      </p>
      <p><b>Types of Phytoplankton</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Diatoms are a type of microalgae with a shell-like structure that is
          responsible for a significant portion of the world's photosynthesis,
          accounting for 20% of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dinoflagellates, on the other hand, have a more complex structure with
          shells and flagella and are responsible for a whopping 50% of the
          world's photosynthesis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Green algae, which contain chlorophyll, require sunlight for growth
          and can be found in both freshwater and marine environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coccolithophores, another type of microalgae, are covered in calcium
          carbonate plates and contribute to 5% of the world's photosynthesis.
          They can be found in both warm and cold waters.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Did you know that cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are
        considered pioneers of planet Earth and are one of the phytoplankton?
        These fascinating organisms are a unique gift of nature, and they come
        in a wide variety of morph types. For example, there are unicellular
        species, as well as surface-attached, filamentous colony-forming, and
        mat-forming species. It's amazing to think about how these Gram-negative
        eubacteria have evolved and adapted over time to become such an integral
        part of our ecosystem.
      </p>

        The molecular methods rely on 16S rRNA gene sequencing as a standard,
        notably at the genus level. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing clusters
        closely correlate with traditional cyanobacterial taxa, which can be
        identified by various phenotypic characteristics.{if this part doesn't
        make any sense then you can understand it to be a unique characteristic
        of cyanobacteria at the RNA level}
      </p>

        Cyanobacteria have been integral to the evolution of life on Earth, as
        they were the first organisms to engage in oxygenic photosynthesis. But
        their significance doesn't stop there. These fascinating organisms also
        play a vital role in the biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nitrogen. It
        is estimated that 20-30% of organic carbon on Earth is derived from
        photosynthetic carbon fixation by cyanobacteria. Additionally, they are
        the primary N2-fixing microorganisms in marine environments. It's
        amazing to think about the impact these tiny organisms have on our
        planet.

        Similarly, marine cyanobacteria have a lot of pharmaceutical potential.
        Recent studies have identified 83 bioactive compounds with potent
        activities, such as cytotoxic, anti-trypanosomal, antibacterial, and
        anticancer properties. These compounds are diverse, belonging to classes
        like cyclic peptides, linear lipopeptides, and depsipeptides. About 43%
        of these compounds exhibit cytotoxic activity, and 8% show
        anti-trypanosomal effects. It's fascinating to think about the potential
        for these tiny organisms to help us improve human health.

        There is a lot of potential in marine cyanobacteria for the development
        of pharmaceuticals. Recent studies have identified 83 bioactive
        compounds with potent activities, including cytotoxic,
        anti-trypanosomal, antibacterial, and anticancer properties. These
        compounds belong to diverse classes such as cyclic peptides, linear

        Specifically, different types of drugs obtained from cyanobacteria have
        been identified to treat various diseases. For example, there are
        antiproliferative and anticancer drugs such as Lagunamide D,
        Portobelamide A and B, and Dysidazirine Carboxylic Acid. Some drugs
        inhibit serine proteases, including Grassystatin D, Grassystatin F,
        Grassystatin, Jizanpeptin A to E, and Tutuilamides A to C. These drugs
        have been extracted from various marine cyanobacteria, including
        Dichothrix sp., Lyngbya sp., Ceramium sp., and Rivularia sp., among
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IC50 values for these drugs, which indicate their potency, vary
        depending on the drug and the type of activity. For example, Compound
        (44) of Grassystatin exhibited potent inhibitory effects with IC50
        values of 50 nM (cathepsin D) and 0.5 nM (cathepsin E). The most potent
        bioactive compound, (47) of Jizanpeptin, exhibited IC50 values of 72 ±
        17 nM (trypsin) and 1400 ± 700 nM (chymotrypsin). Tutuilamides A (50)
        and B (51) were the most dominant inhibitors of elastase, with IC50
        values in the 1-2.05 nM range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cytotoxic activity is a key feature of various compounds extracted from
        marine cyanobacteria. Samoamide A, a compound from Symploca sp., has
        been found to have significant cytotoxic activity against various cells,
        including human lung carcinoma (H-460). Odobromoamide, another compound
        from Okeania sp., has shown significant cytotoxic activity against H-460
        cells. Other compounds, such as Keromamide A from Moorea bouillonii,
        have shown significant cytotoxicity, involving the differentiation of
        neural stem cells into astrocytes.

        It's fascinating to consider the potential of these tiny organisms to
        help improve human health.
