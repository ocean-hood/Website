      <h1>Government Policies</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-text">
      <p>
        The government policies for marine organisms should aim to protect
        living marine resources and ensure environmental protection, water
        quality, and healthy oceans. The major things that should be considered
        include regulations, sustainability, and animal welfare. The government
        can help farmers by providing support through various programs and
        initiatives such as Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP), the Regional
        Aquaculture Center (RAC) program, and research investment. It is
        important to note that many government subsidies lead to overfishing,
        which can harm marine ecosystems and fisheries. Therefore, government
        policy should also aim to reduce harmful subsidies and promote
        sustainable fishing practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
        (MSA). The MSA promotes fishery conservation and economic sustainability
        through science-based catch limits, accountability measures, limited
        access programs, and increased international cooperation, ensuring the
        long-term biological and economic sustainability of marine fisheries for
        the environment and livelihoods.

        Similarly, farmers can employ to limit fertiliser runoff. They can
        improve their drainage systems, plant cover crops to prevent erosion,
        plant trees, shrubs, and grasses along the edges of fields to act as a
        buffer, reduce the frequency and intensity of their tilling, keep their
        livestock out of nearby waterways so they don't transport nutrients,
        and, perhaps most importantly, apply fertiliser correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, governments need to implement policies that recognize the
        importance of microorganisms in climate change and address carbon and
        nitrogen fluxes. An immediate, sustained, and concerted effort is
        required to explicitly include microorganisms in research, technology
        development, and policy and management decisions. Microorganisms not
        only contribute to the rate of climate change but can also contribute
        immensely to its effective mitigation and our adaptation tools. The
        statement also highlights the need to understand microbial interactions
        to help design measures to mitigate and control climate change and its
        effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governments should also fund and assist farmers in their efforts because
        many of them demand an upfront investment, possibly some training, and
        it is more cost-effective to prevent dangerous algal blooms than to try
        to recover from them, not to mention the harm they can do to the
        environment and human health. Agricultural runoff might be regulated
        even if the Clean Water Act already had some rules in place. Governments
        can assist populations with lower incomes that are affected by algal
        blooms in a number of ways. There are a number of possibilities in this
        regard, including passing legislation to stop utilities from turning off
        the water to consumers who refuse to pay, giving water filters,
        educating people about toxic algal blooms, and generally making water
        more affordable.

      <h1>GLOBAL GOVERNANCE</h1>

    <div class="blog-text">
      <p>
        Marine pollution and loss of microbes are critical environmental issues
        requiring global governance. The EPA and UNEA play crucial roles in
        combating marine pollution, but the current governance landscape is
        inadequate to achieve the ambition of ending plastic pollution.
        Effective responses require involving state and non-state actors,
        businesses, and civil society. The UNEA adopted resolution 5/14 in March
        2022, calling for an international agreement to address plastic
        pollution. The EPA helps shape U.S. government positions on
        international marine pollution issues, ensuring international decisions
        and management support the EPA's mission. Ocean governance is crucial in
        addressing marine pollution, involving various stakeholders such as
        governments, international organisations, civil society, and the private
        sector. To improve global governance, coordinated action is needed,
        strengthening legal instruments and institutional frameworks, promoting
        information exchange and regional cooperation, and developing a holistic
        approach based on integrated management and ecosystem approach.
        Increased public awareness and engagement are also essential for ocean
        stakeholders. Microbiome-based strategies can mitigate biodiversity
        decline and help address the complex challenges facing the oceans.

        Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern due to the
        alarming concentration levels of plastics in our surroundings.
        Traditional methods of plastic degradation such as photo-oxidative,
        thermal, Ozone, mechanochemical, and catalytic approaches are costly and
        not suitable for low plastic concentrations. However, microbial use has
        emerged as an eco-friendly and efficient method for plastic degradation.
        To achieve this, it is important to investigate the potential of
        microbes including bacteria, fungi, and algae. Optimum conditions for
        these microbes must be maintained to ensure efficient plastic
        extermination. Additionally, a consortium of aerobic and anaerobic
        bacteria can be used for more effective plastic degradation, and
        successive use of microbes can also be implemented. Enzymes such as
        laccase, lignin-degrading enzymes, urease, lipase, and protease can be
        exploited for plastic degradation under both aerobic and anaerobic
        conditions. Implementing microbial consortia, their processes, and
        enzymes can be an effective and sustainable strategy for plastic
        degradation.
