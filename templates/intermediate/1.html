                Plastics can be categorized into two types: biodegradable and nonhydrolyzable. Nonhydrolyzable plastics, such as PE, PP, PVC, and PS, are composed of C-C bonds that make them resistant to biodegradation. However, microbes can break these plastics down into smaller molecules through redox reactions, which they can then use as a carbon source. PET, PS, and PE (HDPE, LDPE) are some examples of nonhydrolyzable plastics. While PET has limited microbial degradation potential, bacteria like Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F can effectively hydrolyze PET using enzymes. PS is difficult to biodegrade, but certain gut microbiome bacteria have shown promise in degrading it. PE, on the other hand, is highly resistant, but bacterial consortium and fungi have demonstrated the ability to degrade HDPE and LDPE.

                Recent studies have shown that laccases found in actinomycetes, Rhodococcus ruber, and fungi like Aspergillus flavus and Pleurotus ostreatus have demonstrated a high potential for degrading polyethylene (PE). It is believed that these laccases can oxidize the hydrocarbon backbone of PE, leading to its degradation. This finding is significant as it suggests that laccases can serve as a potential tool for developing efficient plastic biodegradation technologies, which could contribute to environmental sustainability.

                Recently, there has been research indicating that some fungi, such as Fusarium solani, Alternaria solani, Aspergillus fumigatus, Spicaria spp., Geomyces pannorum, Phoma sp., and Penicillium spp., have been found to possess significant plastic-degrading properties for LDPE. This discovery is promising as it suggests that certain fungi could potentially be used as a tool for developing effective plastic biodegradation technologies, which in turn could contribute to environmental sustainability.

            <p>
              PET, which is a commonly used thermoplastic, can be broken down by certain bacteria like Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F. These bacteria produce enzymes such as PETase, MHETase, TPA dioxygenase, and PCA dioxygenase that are highly efficient at breaking down PET into environmentally friendly molecules. The cooperation between PETase and MHETase is essential for efficient PET breakdown. Scientists have used genetic engineering to optimize these enzymes, resulting in improved versions that greatly enhance PET depolymerization. Additionally, cutinases like LC-cutinase and Thermobifida fusca cutinase are effective in PET degradation, with LC-cutinase showing better performance.

              Just like PET, PCL is a type of thermoplastic that can be broken down into smaller, environmentally friendly molecules. This process is facilitated by enzymes produced by certain bacteria and microorganisms. For example, lipase can hydrolyze PCL into smaller molecules, which can then be assimilated by microorganisms like Aspergillus sp. strain ST-01, Pseudomonas, Alcanivorax, and Tenacibaculum. The degradation of PCL can also be achieved by thermophilic actinomycetes and thermotolerant bacteria.
