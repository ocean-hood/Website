            Plastics can be categorized into two types: biodegradable and nonhydrolyzable. Nonhydrolyzable plastics, such as PE, PP, PVC, and PS, are composed of C-C bonds that make them resistant to biodegradation. However, microbes can break these plastics down into smaller molecules through redox reactions, which they can then use as a carbon source. PET, PS, and PE (HDPE, LDPE) are some examples of nonhydrolyzable plastics. While PET has limited microbial degradation potential, bacteria like Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F can effectively hydrolyze PET using enzymes. PS is difficult to biodegrade, but certain gut microbiome bacteria have shown promise in degrading it. PE, on the other hand, is highly resistant, but bacterial consortium and fungi have demonstrated the ability to degrade HDPE and LDPE.

          Recent studies have shown that laccases found in actinomycetes, Rhodococcus ruber, and fungi like Aspergillus flavus and Pleurotus ostreatus have demonstrated a high potential for degrading polyethylene (PE). It is believed that these laccases can oxidize the hydrocarbon backbone of PE, leading to its degradation. This finding is significant as it suggests that laccases can serve as a potential tool for developing efficient plastic biodegradation technologies, which could contribute to environmental sustainability.
