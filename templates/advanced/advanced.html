          Cyanobacteria have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth and the biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nitrogen. These microorganisms are responsible for 20-30% of organic carbon on Earth and are the primary nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in marine environments. Marine cyanobacteria are of particular interest to scientists in the fields of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology, as they have demonstrated potent biological activities with potential for drug development. Over 2000 secondary metabolites have been identified from marine cyanobacteria, with compounds like lagunamide D and portobelamide A showing significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Moreover, cyanobacteria play a dominant role in the Earth's nitrogen cycle, using nitrogenase enzymes to reduce N2 to NH3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cyanobacterial fossil record is one of the oldest, reaching back to approximately 3500 Ma. The first colonial coccoid microfossil present in this period was Eoentophysalis belcherensis, Hofmann. Their existence has been reported in intertidal and shallow subtidal environments on a carbonate platform in Canada. A timeline of different cyanobacterial fossils recorded through different eras, mainly over the period ranging from 2500 to 542 million years ago, has been established using a geological time scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marine cyanobacteria have valuable potent secondary metabolites with various biological targets, i.e., cytotoxic activity, antiparasitic activity, serine protease inhibition, anticancer and cell proliferation activity, anti-quorum sensing activity, and antibacterial activity. Between 2017 and 2022, studies identified 83 bioactive compounds with potent activities, including cytotoxic, anti-trypanosomal, antibacterial, and anticancer properties.

          Climate Change and its interrelatedness to microbes
        </h4>
        <p>
          Climate change has a significant impact on phytoplankton in various lakes. Short-term annual and seasonal climate fluctuations, as well as long-term climate trends, affect the composition and development of phytoplankton in these aquatic ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two studies conducted in Lake Mondsee and Lake Garda highlight the connection between large-scale atmospheric patterns and phytoplankton development. Similarly, indirect climate effects in Lake Maggiore reveal that factors like silica, phosphorus, temperature, and wind play crucial roles in species selection. Long-term impacts, including changes in nitrogen and silica availability, as well as rising water temperature and thermal stability, are documented in Lake Piburger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The direct and indirect consequences of rising lake temperatures due to climate change affect phytoplankton through physiological and phenological shifts, alterations in water column stratification, nutrient availability, light conditions, and grazing intensity. Environmental conditions, including thermal regime, affect the sedimentation and horizontal distribution of phytoplankton.

        <h4>
          Inter-relatedness between the ocean and a landlocked country
        </h4>
        <p>
          Coastal and marine biodiversity: Many landlocked countries have no direct access to the ocean, but they may have rivers or lakes that are connected to the ocean. These freshwater bodies can be affected by the same pollutants and contaminants that affect the ocean, which can in turn affect the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Additionally, some landlocked countries may have coastlines on large lakes or seas, such as Lake Victoria or the Caspian Sea, which are also connected to the ocean. The biodiversity of these coastal areas can be affected by human activities such as fishing, aquaculture, and tourism, which can lead to the destruction of habitats and the introduction of pollutants.
                              Ocean-based industries: Many developing countries, including landlocked ones, rely on ocean-based industries such as tourism and fisheries for foreign exchange, income, and jobs. If managed sustainably, these industries can contribute to sustainable development by creating new opportunities for jobs, food security, and clean energy. However, these industries can also negatively impact the environment, especially in developing countries where social and environmental sustainability may not be a priority.

          The Importance of Sustainable Ocean-Based Industries and Conservation Efforts
        </h4><p>
          The ocean plays a critical role in the global economy, with over 90% of trade utilizing sea routes and millions of people relying on it for their livelihoods. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on ocean-related economic activities, and it may take several months before pre-crisis levels are reached again. However, the pandemic also provides an opportunity to rethink and steer economic activities towards greater sustainability. Improving long-term sustainability is more urgent than ever before, and policymakers should prioritize strategies that will stimulate recovery while ensuring the value of marine ecosystems is maintained for current and future generations. The recovery and future development of ocean-based industries in the ocean economy should go hand in hand with conservation efforts to ensure a healthy and sustainable ocean for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing countries depend on ocean-based industries such as tourism and fisheries for foreign exchange, income, and jobs. The global expansion of these existing and new ocean-based sectors could potentially advance sustainable development more broadly by creating new opportunities for jobs, food security, and clean energy and achieving diversified and resilient economies. However, the development of the ocean economy carries real risks, as it often creates low-wage jobs and negatively impacts the environment in developing countries. Many developing countries are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and ocean pollution that degrade the marine ecosystems on which they rely. The international development community should ensure that the development of the global ocean economy benefits all and contributes to setting the global use of ocean resources on a more sustainable footing. Development cooperation can support developing countries to turn both emerging and existing ocean-based sectors into catalysts for long-term, inclusive, and sustainable development.

          The ocean and marine ecosystems provide crucial ecosystem services that drive value within various sectors, including fisheries, recreation, and marine biotechnology. However, the pressures on ocean and ecosystem services are increasing due to anthropogenic impacts such as warming, acidification, and species decline. Additionally, sea levels are rising at an alarming rate, and extreme sea-level events are projected to occur more frequently. These pressures can have cumulative impacts on marine ecosystems, exacerbating issues like overfishing, pollution, and habitat degradation. As a result, the state of marine ecosystems is alarming, with estimates suggesting that 60% of the world's major marine ecosystems have been degraded or are being used unsustainably. The welfare costs imposed on society due to poor ocean management practices are high, with an estimated economic impact of USD 200 billion per year. It is critical to address these pressures and prioritize conservation and sustainable use of the ocean to ensure the continuation of its life-sustaining functions and ecosystem services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ocean plays a crucial role in our world, providing essential services that drive value in various sectors. Unfortunately, human activities such as carbon dioxide emissions have led to ocean acidification, rising sea temperatures, and shifts in ocean currents, which have severe consequences for marine diversity and ecosystems. These impacts are already being seen in habitat loss, changes in fish stock composition and migration patterns, and more severe ocean weather events. Vulnerable coastal communities are particularly at risk, as they depend on the ocean for their quality of life and economic stability. Developing countries, in particular, are at risk of experiencing the worst impacts of climate change on ocean-based economic activities like fishing, aquaculture, and tourism. It is therefore essential to prioritize conservation and sustainable use of the ocean to ensure its continued life-sustaining functions and ecosystem services.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Economic Dimension:
        </h4>
        <p>
          The ocean brings tangible economic benefits to actors around the world. Economic activities from ocean-based industries are those that take place on or in the ocean, using inputs derived from the marine environment, produce goods and services for use on or in the ocean, and/or would not take place were they not located in proximity to the ocean. In addition to these ocean-based economic activities, the marine environment itself brings many benefits. The two are interdependent in that much activity associated with ocean-based industry is derived from marine ecosystems, while most ocean-based industrial activity impacts marine ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h4>Environmental Dimension:</h4>
        <p>
          Marine ecosystems provide invaluable life support functions. Most of these values are not reflected in market prices, which leads to significant negative externalities. Integrating the environmental pillar into sustainability requires that these inherent values are reflected in decision-making processes. This involves understanding the total economic value provided by ecosystems and taking these into account in cost-benefit analysis.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Social Dimension:
        </h4>
        <p>
          The social dimension of sustainable development encompasses many factors, among them poverty alleviation, food security, inclusive growth, and intergenerational equity. The ocean economy is an integral part of the social fabric of many of the world’s people, particularly in developing countries. Subsistence fishery not only provides some coastal populations with food but also contributes to cultural and societal cohesion. The ocean economy also is a key contributor to alleviating poverty and food security.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sustainable ocean economy will only be achieved when the three constitutive economic, environmental, and social dimensions are well understood and robust evidence such as statistical measurement of industries and ecosystems services, adequate environmental impact assessments of economic activities, and social well-being indicators are in place. Institutional and governance mechanisms can contribute to empowering people and moving towards more inclusiveness and equality. The three dimensions of a sustainable ocean economy can then be mutually reinforcing when a policy coherence framework and its control and enforcement measures, such as regulations and economic instruments, are actually in place. The ocean is facing a significant threat from pollution, which has harmful impacts resulting from the entry of chemicals, particles, waste, noise, and invasive organisms. Land-based activities contribute to 80% of marine pollution, including industrial, residential, and agricultural waste, such as plastics and solid waste. Agricultural fertilizers, animal husbandry waste, sewage disposal, and industrial effluents release excessive nutrients into the ocean, leading to eutrophication, which alters marine habitats and negatively impacts fisheries. Marine pollution also originates from direct discharge through ship pollution and deep-sea mining, resulting in acidification, eutrophication, marine litter, toxins, and underwater noise. Marine litter, including plastics, is generated by different economic sectors, such as aquaculture, fisheries, shipping, cosmetics, textiles, and clothing. Plastics are a significant source of ocean pollution, with estimates of between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes entering the ocean each year. Marine plastics have a severe impact on the coastal environment, tourism, and the fisheries industry, with the cost of ocean plastic estimated at USD 13 billion per year. Despite growing evidence of the negative impacts of marine plastics, much progress is still required to address the root of chemical pollution, in terms of both research and development and changing current production and consumption practices. Developing countries experience particular pressures and vulnerabilities, which require attention to manage waste and the presence of marine plastic debris.
